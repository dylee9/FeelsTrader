"Still lots of people don&#39;t understand the difference between sequencing and optical mapping. Let me explain:

Sequencing is getting the actual DNA sequence, simple and clear. 

Optical Mapping is like.. putting different color dots whenever you see some special sequence in the molecule, then through reading the positions of the color dots, you know relative positions of sequences without knowing the actual sequence.

e.g. for a sequencing of AACCGGTT, bionano can put marks for â€œACâ€œ and â€œGTâ€œ, then output of the bionano machine will be like ?AC??GT?
if the output is like ??GT?AC? then you will know there probably has been a SV, but you don&#39;t know the actual sequence

Note the distance of each &quot;dot&quot; is about 500 base-pairs (each base-pair is 1 DNA character).  That mean you will not able to identify sequence variation that is smaller than 500bp"
